== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a QR Code? =
Read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code">Wikipedia QR Code article</a>.


= Will there be a PHP4 version? =

No. This plugin is based on OOP sytle which is not available in PHP4.
Please upgrade your PHP installation.

= Does it work with PHP 5.3? =

Yes it does.

= Does it work with PHP 6? =

I don't know. Not tested yet.

= Which image type should I choose? =

PNG is the preferred one. If you're concerned about very old browser, use GIF instead. Or JPEG.

= Which code generator should I choose? =

If you're on a webserver that disallows online connection from within php scripts, you should switch over to the QR Code Lib.

= There is a red image instead of the QR Code image. What's wrong? =

You're `/qr-code-tag/data/` directory is _not writeable_. Please adjust
your permissions. See <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions">Changing File Permissions</a>.

= How to use the tooltip mode? =

See Plugin Help (below Plugin settings in your WordPress administration area).

= There is only a blank page for large posts with your plugin! Why? =

This is a PHP / WordPress problem. See <a href="http://www.undermyhat.org/blog/2009/07/sudden-empty-blank-page-for-large-posts-with-wordpress/">Sudden empty / blank page for large posts with WordPress</a> for problem description and solutions.

= The margin with the Google API differs from that one created by the QR Code Lib. Why? =

Google Chart API creates a different margin. I can't tell you why - ask Google.

= How I can check the generated QR Code? =

You can use the <a href="http://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx">Google ZXing online service</a> 

= Where I can download a barcode reader for my mobile device? =

= The plugin is not available in (_put a language in here_). Why? =

Because no one translated it yet. How about you? See Plugin Help for translation hints!

= There source code format does not follow WordPress standards. Why? =

This plugin obeys the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/coding-standard.html">Zend Framework Coding Standard for PHP</a> 
because the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards">WordPress Coding Standard</a> does not fit OOP, IMHO. Sorry Matt.
